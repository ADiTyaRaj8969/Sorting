    Sorts a list in place using the Shell Sort algorithm.

    Type: Comparison-based, Not stable, In-place

    Time Complexity (Worst Case):
    Depends on the gap sequence used.
    - Original Shellâ€™s sequence (n/2, n/4, ...): O(n^2)
    - Better sequences (e.g., Sedgewick): Can reach O(n^(4/3))
    - Best Case: O(n log n)

    Space Complexity:
    - Auxiliary Space: O(1) -> In-place sorting
